# LearnWeb3Dao Interview Task

This Project is designed to test my frontend, backend, and web3 skillsets.
I will be working with similar technologies on the job.
This is a feature that already exists on the LearnWeb3 platform 
They’re just interested in seeing how I would’ve designed this given the opportunity.
